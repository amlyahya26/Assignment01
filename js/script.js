/* 
 STEP 1 : In my first steps I created a GitHub account for the first time in my academic life I knew about this site.
 I applied your steps in the first lecture, which were to create an Assignment file, 
 then make it public, copy the URL, and then put it in the VS program.

 STEP 2 : After linking the GitHub website with the VS application, I created the html and applied what was required

 STEP 3 : After that, I executed and created a JS file with a Script.js file inside it. I commented and explained what was implemented.
 After that, I went to the scurce control menu to push the menu that was created
  so that it appears on the github website and pressed the commit button.

To fix it, we can escape the apostrophe inside the double-quoted string by using a backslash (\).*/
